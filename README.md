## <a name="en"></a>Project Description
You are to build a web page from a provided mock-up.  The mockup can be found at:
http://uidesign.moregoldtech.com/acme/#artboard0

Most of the assets in the mockup can be found at:
http://uidesign.moregoldtech.com/acme/#artboard1

## Project Requirements
Requirements for this webpage are:
  - From a pixel standpoint, Be as close to the mockup as possible
  - We are not providing designs for different viewpoint breakpoints.  However, you site should at least have a mobile breakpoint.  
  - There should be a slide show in the "Our Programs" and "Our Events" sections.  There are six images for each slide show (found in the assets artboard) labeled as Gallery 1 and Gallery 2.  Use Gallery 1 with Our Programs and Gallery 2 with Our Events.  The slide show should not auto-advance and should wrap, meaning that if I am on slide 6 and I hit forward, it should advance to slide 1.

## Project Instructions
  1. Build the web page with whatever technology stack you feel most comfortable with.  This can even be a static page.
  2. Please include instructions on how to build/demo your web page.
  3. Email the completed application with all the source code as a zip file to: <dkam@moregoldtech.com>
 
## Project Notes
Things to keep in mind:
  - Please do not spend more than 8 hours building this web page.
  - We are trying to determine your HTML/CSS/JS skill level.
  - We will not be judging how the mobile version of the page look, but whether or not it is even responsive.
  - This is your chance to show off what you can do.
  
  
**Good luck!!**
